## Preparation

1. **Hardware assembly:**
- Connect the heating element and fans to the iHeater.
   - Install the thermistors in the camera and connect them to the appropriate pins of the MCU.
   - Make sure that the pins are connected correctly according to the configuration file.

2. **Installation of the necessary files:**
- Copy the file `rp2040_pin_aliases.cfg` and `iHeaterMCU.cfg` to the Klipper configuration directory.

## Installing firmware on iHeater

1. **Assemble the Klipper firmware for RP2040:**

   cd klipper/
   make menuconfig


**In the configuration menu, select:**

 - Micro-controller Architecture: RP2040
 - Processor model: rp2040
 - Leave the rest of the settings as default.

**Save and exit the menu.**

2. **Compile the firmware:**

        make

3. **Installing the firmware on the iHeter board:**

- Connect the Iheater to the computer in programming mode (by holding the BOOTSEL button when connected).

- Mount the device and download the firmware:

        sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
        sudo cp out/klipper.uf2 /mnt
        sudo umount /mnt

> **Note:** Replace /dev/sda1 with the appropriate path to your device.

## Klipper Configuration

Copy the iHeaterMCU.cfg and rp2040_pin_aliases.cfg configuration files to the printer.cfg folder and enable it using the [include] directive.

        {% endif %}
        
- Description:
- Monitors the temperature and controls the fan depending on the set logic.
    - The fan turns on when the chamber temperature reaches 50°C.

## Usage
### Camera heating control commands
- Setting the camera temperature:
 

        M141 S60 ; Sets the camera temperature to 60°C

- Waiting for the temperature to reach:

        M191 S60 ; Waits until the camera temperature reaches 60°C

- Stopping the heating of the chamber:

        M141 S0 ; Turns off the heating of the camera


## Automation and control logic
The _iHEATER_CONTROL macro automatically controls the fan depending on the temperature of the camera.
When the temperature reaches 50°C, the iHeater_F fan turns on.
Macros can be customized to your requirements by changing the thresholds and logic.


## Notes
- Security:

    - Make sure that all connections are made correctly and securely.
    - Check that the min_temp and max_temp values match the hardware specifications.

- Checking the equipment:
- Before using, test the operation of the heater and fan.
    - Keep an eye on the temperature during the first launches.
- Setting up the PID:
    - If necessary, perform PID calibration for accurate temperature control.
